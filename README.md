# 42_corewar
Unusual game to play. <br>
This project is to recreate a 1984 programming game "Core War". There are two(three) programms:
1) ASM - assembler or pseudo assembler, which translate instructions to bytecode
2) COREWAR - virtual machine or arena where champions, created with assembler, fight
3) DISASM - disassembler, not mandatory part, but it helps a lot to recreate original .s file and see used instructions

There are so many rules about this game, so I don't see any necessity to put them here. I just left en.corewar.subject and
link to the cookbook, where it is desrcibed in the slightest details https://github.com/avocadohooman/42-Corewar/wiki
