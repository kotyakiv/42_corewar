# 42_corewar
An unusual game to play. <br>
This project is to recreate a 1984 programming game "Core War". There are three programmes:
1) ASM - an assembler or a pseudo assembler, which translates instructions to bytecode
2) COREWAR - a virtual machine or arena where champions, created with the assembler, fight
3) DISASM - a disassembler, not a mandatory part, but it helps a lot to recreate the original .s file and see the used instructions

There are so many rules about this game, that I don't see any necessity to put them here. I just left en.corewar.subject and
a link to the cookbook, where it is desrcibed in detail https://github.com/avocadohooman/42-Corewar/wiki
